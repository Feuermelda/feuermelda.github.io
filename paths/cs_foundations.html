                <h3>Introduction</h3>
                <p>
                    Before diving into advanced topics like AI or cybersecurity, I wanted to build a solid foundation -
                    not
                    just theory, but actual system-level fluency.<br>
                    This 8-week learning path focused on the 80/20 principle: learning the 20% of core concepts that
                    unlock
                    80% of practical understanding in computer systems.<br>
                    The goal?<br>
                    To go from curious explorer to confident builder - someone who understands how machines think, not
                    just
                    how to command them.

            <h3>Final Project: Eely OS Helper</h3>
            <div>
                <p>I built a quirky command-line assistant named Eely OS Helper - a fully interactive Bash tool that:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Backs up files</li>
                    <li>Simulates CPU scheduling</li>
                    <li>Displays system stats</li>
                    <li>Cleans up your machine</li>
                    <li>Shows you love with colored terminal messages and optional eel ASCII art</li>
                </ul>

            <h3>Outcome</h3>
            <div>
                <p>This learning path gave me the confidence to poke at the machine's internals, not just its UI.<br>
                    I now script with ease, debug like a mini-sysadmin, and understand what happens under the hood of
                    any app I write.<br>
                    It was the beginning of building a real technical identity - and one eel of a good time.</p>
