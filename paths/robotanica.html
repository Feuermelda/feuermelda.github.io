        <h2>Electronics & Embedded Basics - grown inside a robot eel</h2>

        <section>
            <h3>Introduction</h3>
            <p>
                RoBotanica is my electronics + microcontroller learning path built around one real robot:
                <b>Eelbert</b><br>
                Instead of random tutorials, every theory week is tied to something physical: power, LEDs, sensors,
                motors, and safe switching.<br>
                The goal is simple: understand electronics deeply enough to design, debug, and iterate real builds - not
                just copy wiring diagrams.

            <h3>Outcome</h3>
            <p><i>In progress.</i><br>
                By the end of RoBotanica, I’ll be comfortable reading schematics, choosing parts intentionally (not by
                vibes), and
                integrating power + logic + sensors + actuators into a stable real-world build.
