            <h3>Introduction</h3>
            <p>
                JavaScript Speech is my hands-on journey to mastering how to make web pages come alive.<br />
                Starting with the core language fundamentals, I progressed through DOM manipulation,
                interactivity, and real-world user experience enhancements.<br />
                This curriculum is guided by practical weekly challenges - often inspired by Milk and Eel -
                and filled with dynamic, often absurd, mini-projects that made the learning fun.

            <h3>Outcome</h3>
            <p><i>To be filled upon completion</i><br>
                By the end of this path, I aim to be confident writing clean, interactive JavaScript -
                able to manipulate any page, handle real-time user input, load and display structured data,
                and enhance accessibility and feedback through DOM control.<br />
                Plus: a deeply personal JS library of Milk and Eel absurdities.
