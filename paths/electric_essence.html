            <h3>Introduction</h3>
            <p>
                Before diving deeper into software and abstract systems, I wanted to understand the physical layer
                beneath it all.<br>
                Electric Essence is my hands-on journey into electronics and Arduino - where current becomes logic, and
                components become behavior. <br>Through building, measuring, debugging, and breaking things, I learned
                how
                signals flow, how hardware fails, and how software and electricity negotiate control.<br>
                This path isn’t about memorizing parts - it’s about developing intuition: thinking in voltages, timing,
                and state, and learning how tiny machines come alive when logic meets current.

            <h3>Outcome</h3>
            <p>By completing Electric Essence, I’ve built a strong practical foundation in electronics and Arduino
                systems. I can now:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Design, wire, and debug basic to intermediate circuits</li>
                <li>Read and combine sensor inputs reliably</li>
                <li>Control actuators (LEDs, buzzers, motors, relays)</li>
                <li>Reason about power, timing, and system state</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Most importantly, I've developed hardware intuition - the ability to diagnose issues, anticipate failure
                points, and turn ideas into working physical devices.</p>
