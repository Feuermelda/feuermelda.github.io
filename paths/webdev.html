        <p class=" haiku">Tags and semantic,<br>
    layout never out of style,<br>
    responsive design
    </p>
    <h2>HTML meets Milk - CSS meets Eel</h2>
    <section>
        <h3>Introduction</h3>
        <p>This was my first complete web development path - a journey that started with &ltsection&gt tags and
            endedd with dark mode toggles, spider-themed 404s, and a portfolio built by me.<br>
            Guided by my own fictional duo, Milk (a sentient milk carton) and Eel (a curious moray eel),<br>
            I explored how to structure content, style with intention, and make sites responsive, accessible, and
            memorable.<br>
            I didn't pursue this path because I wanted to become a frontend dev - I did it because I wanted to be
            capable. Now I am.<br>
            This website was created with the guidance of ChatGPT. I merely used it for learning, so I could apply
            that onto my real Portfolio website.<br>
            However, some parts are created or enhanced by my influence.</p>

        <h3>Why "Milk & Eel"?</h3>
        <p>They're two fictional characters I created - part of an ongoing surreal saga.<br>
            They represent both silliness and sincerity. So I brought that same energy into this learning path.<br>
            You'll find traces of them all over the site:
        <ul>
            <li>Colorful card layouts</li>
            <li>Themed Easter eggs</li>
            <li>Spider cameos</li>
        </ul>
        This was never just about building a site. It was about giving my portfolio a soul. And to have fun while
        coding.
